# Guitar learning website
This is a website I built from my Human-computer interaction design class.
## Description of the website 
The home page as you can see is split in three sections:
  1. The left side is meant for absolute beginners. This section contains information about the instrument, chords, and beginner songs. It serves as a starting point for newcomers.
  2. The right side is meant for more experienced players. Users can learn from others and post their own interpretations of songs. Clicking on one of the songs directs you to another page where you'll find a link containing a video tutorial of the song. Additionally, you'll have access to the song in written format and instructions on how to play it. You can edit or delete a certain post, but only if it was written by you.
  3. The navigation bar is a standard bar with an additional 'Add Song' button, which directs the user to another page. On that page, there are fields that should be filled with specific values. Upon submission, the song appears on the right side of the page.
## Technologies used
For the backend of the project, I used Python Django, and for the frontend, I utilized Bootstrap.
